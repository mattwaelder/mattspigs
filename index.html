            Guinea Pigs, for the uninitiated are vegetable compactors which lack
            traditional hydraulic mechanisms as well as tails. Guinea pigs are
            not from papua new guinea and are from a cage in my livingroom. The
            optimal number of pigs is 2, ask anybody. Guinea Pigs also have
            talons not unlike birds of prey (which tend to also lack tails).
            Guinea Pigs make for better pets than most other animals with
            talons, and even have the ability to clean themselves. This allows
            for Guinea Pigs to go much longer than the average vehicle without a
            wash. Owners of geepee's should provide a healthy diet of
            consturctive criticism, positive reinforcment, and those treats that
            they like even though they are kind of expensive.

              Guinea pigs should always exist in pairs, at least. This is
              because piggies are social creatures and get a lot of comfort from
              a cagemate. Because of this, and the fact that piggies are not the
              best climbers, they require a sizeable living space. There are
              lots of numbers out there, but for two guinea pigs you should try
              to have at least 8 square feet. This isnt a hard rule, however,
              and a lot can be said about open space versus space taken up by
              toys and hideys. In general, the bigger the space, the happier the
              herd.

            <p class="tab_content_p">
              Guinea pigs eat a LOT... like, a lot. I go to Vons like twice a
              week to stock up on veggies for them piggies. You want to give
              them things like romaine lettuce, and green-leaf lettuce rather
              than those heads of lettuce that have no nutritional value. They
              should also have a good amount of vitamin C in their diet since
              they cant produce it themselves--think bell peppers. Avoid foods
              like spinach and kale, the dark greens are bad for pig health over
              time but are fine in moderation. Other than the veggies, pigs
              ought to be fed BALES OF HAY. Yea, like a horse would eat. Timothy
              hay in unholy quantities needs to be pumped into the pigs on the
              daily. For an OPTIMAL PIG, something like 70% of its diet should
              be hay. There's also the pellets, theyre kind of expensive but
              they give the aforementioned vitamin C, and the pigs like \'em. If
              those pigs been good you can also give them treats if you like,
              these are usually compressed hay with additions, but the pigs love
              the sound of rustling bags, and they seem to like treats too. It
              also doesnt hurt that guinea pigs eat people food, so you can use
              food stamps to buy food for your pigs. Welfare pigs.

            <h2 class="tab_content_heading">health</h2>
            <p class="tab_content_p">
              A healthy life-span for a piggy is about 6 years. they can
              certainly go much longer than that--10 ish--but thats with a bit
              of luck and a lot of care. Before getting a piggy its important to
              have plans and money for their health needs. Guinea pigs require
              special vets who work on "exotic" animals like rabbits and birds.
              Because they are classified as exotic pets the vet bills tend to
              be higher for even basic checkups. Pigs adopted from big pet
              stores also frequently come with issues from the breeder. My pigs
              had mites, and so I had to buy ivermectin (that horse de-wormer
              that all the zoomers were eating during the pandemic) and apply a
              tiny amount to the backs of my pigs ears to rid them of the mites.
              Worse yet sometimes the pet store can misgender your pig and not
              even get cancelled; this generally leaves you with way more pigs
              than you intended on buying and is a big reason for the existence
              of guinea pig rescues. Before you bring a pig into your home make
              sure that you can provide the proper space and the proper food, so
              you dont have to worry as much about the health care costs.
