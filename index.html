            Guinea Pigs, for the uninitiated are vegetable compactors which lack
            traditional hydraulic mechanisms as well as tails. Guinea pigs are
            not from papua new guinea and are from a cage in my livingroom. The
            optimal number of pigs is 2, ask anybody. Guinea Pigs also have
            talons not unlike birds of prey (which tend to also lack tails).
            Guinea Pigs make for better pets than most other animals with
            talons, and even have the ability to clean themselves. This allows
            for Guinea Pigs to go much longer than the average vehicle without a
            wash. Owners of geepee's should provide a healthy diet of
            consturctive criticism, positive reinforcment, and those treats that
            they like even though they are kind of expensive.
