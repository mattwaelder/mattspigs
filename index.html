          Guinea Pigs, for the uninitiated are vegetable compactors which lack
          traditional hydraulic mechanisms as well as tails. Guinea pigs are not
          from papua new guinea and are from a cage in my livingroom. The
          optimal number of pigs is 2, ask anybody. Guinea Pigs also have talons
          not unlike birds of prey (which tend to also lack tails). Guinea Pigs
          make for better pets than most other animals with talons, and even
          have the ability to clean themselves. This allows for Guinea Pigs to
          go much longer than the average vehicle without a wash. Owners of
          geepee's should provide a healthy diet of consturctive criticism,
          positive reinforcment, and those treats that they like even though
          they are kind of expensive.
